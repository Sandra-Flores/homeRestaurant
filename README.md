# HomeRestaurant

HomeRestaurant is a web application for entrepreneurs who want to make business working from home and for college students or any other people who want to eat home cooked meals but donâ€™t have the time or experience to cook it themselves. Our web application will allow the users to create their own account, sign in through facebook or search as a guess to use our application. It allows users to create their own restaurant by simply adding the name, description and location. Users will also be able to search for stores around them using google maps.

## How to run it

To run the homeRestaurant application is not too complicated.
 * You can run the application from Heroku here [https://home-restaurant.herokuapp.com/] 
 * If you have access to c9 you can click on the run button under the express configurations and then preview the running app
 
## [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Sandra-Flores/homeRestaurant/tree/master)

For CircleCI we had to connect our circleCI to automatically check every deployment and test our code. We also connected it to our Heroku application to make sure it wouldn't upload any code that would break our app.

## Lessons learned

* Communicate often with your team and make sure you are all on the same page
* Divide the work early and evenly
